Decision Tree for Facial Expression Classification
==================================================

This Matlab code is used for training the decision trees for the classification of facial expressions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise).

12 trees (6 for clean, 6 for noisy) will be generated and evaluated for both clean and noisy datasets via 10-fold cross validation and depth selection scheme.
